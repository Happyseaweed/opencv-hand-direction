# opencv-hand-direction
A simple (not yet super accurate) python program that detects which direction the hands move in after pinching/grabbing. Can be used for hands-free control.

Created this as I wanted to build a hands-free OS. There are a few problems I ran into: my camera does not capture fast enough so the hand_landmarks sort of jitter all over the place,
decreasing overall accuracy. The camera also does not auto focus.
